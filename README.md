# VisionTests

I find that the test that my opthalmpologist uses to assess my vision
(eye charts, reading card, etc.) don't really assess my vision in the
ways trhat matter to me (eg reading web pages or my smart phone).

I decied to create a web page that consisted of random words where the
font size got progressively smaller.

The word list
{2000_words.txt)[2000_words.txt]
came from
