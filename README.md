# VisionTests

I find that the test that my opthalmpologist uses to assess my vision
(eye charts, reading card, etc.) don't really assess my vision in the
ways trhat matter to me (eg reading web pages or my smart phone).

I decied to create a web page that consisted of random words where the
font size got progressively smaller.

[This test](https://MarkNahabedian.github.io/VisionTests/words-test.html)
displays random words at progressively smaller font sizes.  You can
choose the font family and weight.

The word list
{2000_words.txt)[2000_words.txt]
came from
